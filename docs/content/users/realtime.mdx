# Real-Time Updates

Auktiva supports real-time updates, meaning you see changes instantly without refreshing the page. When someone places a bid, posts a comment, or sends you a notification, it appears immediately.

## How It Works

When real-time is enabled by your administrator, Auktiva uses WebSocket connections to push updates directly to your browser. This provides:

- **Instant bid updates** - See new bids the moment they're placed
- **Live discussions** - Comments appear in real-time as others post
- **Immediate notifications** - Get notified instantly when you're outbid or receive messages

## What Updates in Real-Time

### On Item Pages

When viewing an item, you'll see live updates for:

- **New bids** - The current bid amount and bid history update instantly
- **Discussion comments** - New comments and replies appear without refreshing
- **Deleted comments** - Removed comments disappear immediately

### Notifications

Your notification bell updates in real-time:

- **New notifications** - Appear instantly in your notification list
- **Unread count** - The badge updates as new notifications arrive
- **Outbid alerts** - Get notified immediately when someone outbids you

## Connection Status

You can check if real-time is working by looking at your browser's developer console (F12). When connected, you'll see messages like:

```
[Realtime:Client] Connected successfully!
```

## Fallback Behavior

If real-time is not available (disabled by admin, connection issues, or unsupported browser), Auktiva automatically falls back to polling:

- The page will refresh data every few seconds
- You'll still see updates, just with a slight delay
- No action needed on your part - it happens automatically

## Privacy & Security

Real-time updates are secure:

- **Private channels** - Your personal notifications are only visible to you
- **Auction membership** - You only receive updates for auctions you're a member of
- **Encrypted connections** - All data is transmitted securely (when TLS is enabled)

You cannot see other users' private notifications or access auctions you're not invited to.

## Troubleshooting

### Updates Not Appearing

1. **Check your connection** - Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes a page refresh re-establishes the connection
3. **Check browser console** - Look for connection errors (F12 → Console tab)
4. **Try a different browser** - Some older browsers may not support WebSockets

### Delayed Updates

If updates seem delayed:

- Real-time may be disabled - the system falls back to polling (every 2-30 seconds)
- Your network may have WebSocket restrictions (some corporate firewalls block them)
- Contact your administrator if the issue persists

## Key Concepts

### Auctions

An auction is a container for items you want to sell or bid on. Each auction has settings for who can join and how bidding works.

### Items

Items are the things being auctioned. Each item has a name, description, starting bid, and images.

### Bids

Bids are offers to purchase an item. The highest bid when an item ends wins.

### Members

Members are users who participate in an auction. Each member has a role that determines what they can do.

# Deployment Administration

Auktiva includes a deployment administration system that allows a single user to manage updates and system-level settings for a self-hosted instance.

## Overview

The Deployment Admin is a special role that exists at the system level (not per-auction). This user can:

- View version information and check for updates
- Install updates directly from the settings page
- Transfer admin rights to another user

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout type="info">
  The Deployment Admin is different from auction Owners/Admins. Auction roles
  control auction-specific permissions, while the Deployment Admin manages the
  entire Auktiva instance.
</Callout>

## How It Works

### Database Model

The deployment admin is stored in the `SystemSettings` table (singleton pattern):

```prisma
model SystemSettings {
  id                    String   @id @default("system")
  deploymentAdminEmail  String?  // Email of the deployment admin
  autoCheckUpdates      Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt             DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt             DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

### Claiming Admin Rights

The first user to claim deployment admin rights becomes the admin:

1. Any authenticated user can go to **Settings**
2. Scroll to **Deployment Administration** section
3. If no admin is set, click **"Become Deployment Admin"**
4. The user's email is saved as `deploymentAdminEmail`

<Callout type="warning">
  Only one user can be the Deployment Admin at a time. Once claimed, other users
  will see "Another user is the Deployment Admin" and cannot claim the role.
</Callout>

### Transferring Admin Rights

The current Deployment Admin can transfer rights to another user:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Deployment Administration**
2. Enter the email of the new admin in the transfer field
3. Click **"Transfer"**
4. The new user must be a registered Auktiva user

### Account Deletion Restriction

Users who are the Deployment Admin **cannot delete their account** until they transfer admin rights to someone else. This prevents orphaning the deployment without an administrator.

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/system/settings

Returns current system settings. Requires authentication.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "deploymentAdminEmail": "admin@example.com",
  "autoCheckUpdates": true
}
```

### PATCH /api/system/settings

Updates system settings. Used for claiming/transferring admin rights.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "deploymentAdminEmail": "newadmin@example.com"
}
```

**Authorization Logic:**

- If no admin is set: any authenticated user can claim
- If admin is set: only current admin can transfer

### POST /api/system/update

Triggers an update. Only accessible by the Deployment Admin.

**What it does:**

1. Runs `scripts/update.sh` in the background
2. The script handles git pull, npm install, build, and restart

### GET /api/version

Returns version information for the deployment.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "currentVersion": "1.0.0",
  "latestVersion": "1.1.0",
  "updateAvailable": true,
  "releaseUrl": "https://github.com/thomsa/auktiva/releases/tag/v1.1.0"
}
```

## Update Script

The update process is handled by `scripts/update.sh`. You can customize this script for your deployment environment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/update.sh

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Build the application
npm run build

# Restart the application (customize for your environment)
# pm2 restart auktiva
# systemctl restart auktiva
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The default update script is a template. You must customize it for your
  specific deployment environment (PM2, systemd, Docker, etc.).
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

### Single Admin Model

The single-admin model is intentional for simplicity. For multi-admin scenarios, consider:

- Using infrastructure-level access controls
- Sharing credentials securely among trusted administrators
- Implementing custom modifications for your organization

### Transfer Validation

When transferring admin rights:

- The target email must belong to a registered user
- The transfer is immediate (no confirmation email)
- The previous admin loses access immediately

### Account Deletion Protection

The system prevents Deployment Admins from deleting their accounts to ensure:

- There's always someone who can manage updates
- The deployment isn't orphaned without administration
- Intentional handoff of responsibilities

## Service Layer

The deployment admin logic is implemented in `src/lib/services/system.service.ts`:

```typescript
// Check if a user is the deployment admin
export async function isDeploymentAdmin(userEmail: string): Promise<boolean>;

// Get system settings
export async function getSystemSettings(): Promise<SystemSettings>;

// Update system settings (claim/transfer admin)
export async function updateSystemSettings(
  data: Partial<SystemSettings>
): Promise<SystemSettings>;
```

## Frontend Integration

The Settings page (`src/pages/settings.tsx`) includes the Deployment Administration section that:

1. Shows current admin status
2. Displays version information (for admins)
3. Provides transfer functionality (for admins)
4. Shows claim button (when no admin is set)
5. Shows "admin already set" message (for non-admins when admin exists)

## Troubleshooting

### "Another user is the Deployment Admin"

This means someone has already claimed admin rights. Contact them to transfer rights if needed.

### Cannot Delete Account

If you see "You must transfer deployment admin rights before deleting your account":

1. Go to Settings → Deployment Administration
2. Transfer admin rights to another registered user
3. Then proceed with account deletion

### Update Script Fails

Check the server logs for errors. Common issues:

- Git conflicts (resolve manually)
- Permission issues (check file ownership)
- Missing dependencies (check Node.js version)
- Process manager not configured (customize restart command)

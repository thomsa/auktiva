# Installation

There are two ways to install Auktiva: using the automated installer or manual installation.

## Automated Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our one-line installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomsa/auktiva/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This script will:

1. Check for Node.js (18+) and Git
2. Clone the repository to your current directory
3. Install dependencies
4. Launch an interactive setup wizard

### Setup Wizard

The setup wizard guides you through configuring:

- **Storage**: Local filesystem or S3-compatible storage
- **Database**: SQLite (local) or Turso (cloud)
- **Authentication**: Generates secure secrets
- **Feature flags**: Enable/disable open auctions

After configuration, it automatically:

1. Generates the Prisma client
2. Pushes the database schema
3. Seeds initial data (currencies)
4. Builds the application
5. Optionally installs and starts PM2

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thomsa/auktiva.git
cd auktiva
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration. See [Configuration](/developers/configuration) for details.

### 4. Set Up Database

Generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Push the schema to your database:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

Seed initial data:

```bash
npm run seed:currencies
```

### 5. Build and Run

For development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

For production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```
